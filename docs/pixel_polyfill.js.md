# Facebook Pixel "polyfill"

This small library does it possible to send events to Facebook Pixel in any template. The events it tracks are an entry to a product, when a product is added to the cart and when the purchase is finished. However, due to the lack of standardization between the templates, it's really difficult to get information about these events, which might change in the future, when the whole platform would be rebuilt.
